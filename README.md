# WiLS / Recollection Wisconsin – User Flow Prototypes

This repo hosts **three** separate Vite/React prototypes on **GitHub Pages**:

- `/tree/` – Tree User Flow
- `/interactive/` – Interactive User Flow
- `/everyone/` – User Flow for Everyone

After GitHub Pages is enabled and the workflow has run, your links will look like:

- `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`
- `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/tree/`
- `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/interactive/`
- `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/everyone/`

The GitHub Action `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` builds each app and deploys everything as one static site.
